# HttpGet-Support

**Implement this HttpGet function to run URL's in your script.**

```lua
httpget("https://pastebin.com") --replace with your link
--may be slow at some times depending on your internet download speed

if httpget then print"" else warn"bruh u fucked a step up" end
```

You can rename `httpget()` to anything but it wont work in loadstrings.

Check update logs! Now It supports loadstring! Your welcome.
